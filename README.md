# Portfoloio Project

## Objectives:
The purpous of this project is to begin mapping out the perameters of a GitHub portfolio page. At this point in my career, I have very limited experience in coding and absolutely no professional credentials. The end result, however, will be a full-fledged portfolio and resume page with a completely active and usable contact page.In short, the model followed opens on a biography page with headshot and bio:
![GitHub Bio](Images/gitBio.png)
This page contains a brief mission statement that highlights the subject's skills and intagible attributes along with a headshot and links to Github, LinkedIn and a downloadable resume.

Next is the portfolio page:
![GitHub Portfolio](Images/gitPortfolio.png)
As future projects and assignments are completed, they will be added in place of placeholder images. The plan is also to include links to relavant applications.

Finally, there is a contact page:
![GitHub Contact](Images/gitContact.png)
This contact was based on a form found on the web. The link with the base code is included in the [Reference Links](ReferenceLinks/Links.txt) along with links to all the photos used on the page. There are also portions of the code commented out that I have kept for possible future use.

[Here](https://geoff7709.github.io/) is the link for the final product.
