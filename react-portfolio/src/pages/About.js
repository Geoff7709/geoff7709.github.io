                        <p className="card-text">	Full stack web developer referencing a background in acting and the service industry to provide an engaging and satisfying user experience. Currently earning a certificate in Full Stack Development at Northwestern University with current skills in HTML, JS, CSS, and multiple front-end frameworks and APIâ€™s. Starting with my undergraduate degree in acting I have cultivated a desire to entertain and comfort those around me. After spending the first half of my professional life in the service industry, I have gained a deep appreciation and passion for fulfilling the needs of a variety of clients. I have also developed very strong teamwork skills both as a leading and supporting member to guide guests through a truly enjoyable and memorable experience.  Most recently as a member of a programming team, I was able to apply analytical skills with more than a little creativity to develop a Covid info and tracking application that presents data in a mobile-first, accessible format. Combining this service-oriented attitude with technical skills in coding and great problem solving I look forward to exercising my creativity in building engaging  and dynamic applications.</p>
